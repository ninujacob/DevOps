## Deployment
In Kubernetes, a Deployment is an object that manages the lifecycle and scaling of a set of identical Pods. Deployments enable you to declaratively define and manage the desired state of your application, including how many replicas of the application should be running, what Pod template to use, and how to perform updates and rollbacks

#### Create deployment
Deployment can be created either using an imperative(command) method or declerative(manifest/defnition file) method
