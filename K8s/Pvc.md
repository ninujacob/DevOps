## About
A Kubernetes persistent volume (PV) is an object that allows pods to access persistent storage on a storage device, defined via a Kubernetes StorageClass.
A PV is a resource object in a Kubernetes cluster which continues to exist even after the pods using it have been destroyed. PVs must be requested through persistent volume claims (PVCs), which are requests for storage.
