## Assignment 1: Software installation
- **Script 1:** Write a program to install the **curl** package on different Linux distros(debain, redhat, alpine). Use the **case** condition in the program,to check/install package. The program should exit with the stderr "Distro not identified" if the OS is different than the list.
## Assignment 2: File Operations
- **Script 1:** Write a script that takes a directory path as an argument and lists all the files in that directory.
- **Script 2:** Create a script that renames all files in a directory with a **.txt** extension to have a prefix **"backup_"** (e.g., **file.txt** becomes **backup_file.txt**).
- **Script 3:** Write a script that takes two file paths as arguments and compares them. If they are identical, print a message saying so; otherwise, display the differences
## Assignment 3: System Information
- **Script 1:** Develop a script that displays information about the system, including the operating system, kernel version, CPU information, and available memory.
- **Script 2:** Write a script that checks if a specific process is running. If it is, print a message; otherwise, start the process.
- **Script 3:** Create a script that monitors the disk space usage of a particular partition and sends an email alert if the usage exceeds a specified threshold.
## Assignment 4: Data Manipulation
- **Script 1:** Write a script that reads a CSV file (comma-separated values) and prints the sum of values in a specific column.
- **Script 2:** Develop a script that reads a log file and extracts IP addresses that made more than a specified number of requests.
- **Script 3:** Create a script that takes a sentence as input and prints the number of occurrences of each word.
## Assignment 5: Network Operations
- **Script 1:** Write a script that checks if a list of remote servers is reachable over SSH.
- **Script 2:** Develop a script that pings a list of IP addresses and reports the average response time.
- **Script 3:** Create a script that checks if a website is up by sending an HTTP request and analyzing the response.
## Assignment 6: User Management

- **Script 2:** Develop a script that checks the strength of a user's password.
- **Script 3:** Create a script that lists all users in the system and their login times.
### Guidelines:
- Ensure that the scripts are well-commented for clarity.
- Include error handling mechanisms where appropriate.
- Encourage the use of functions to modularize the code.
- Provide a sample or description of the expected output for each script.
- Use the GitLab SaaS for the entire process
