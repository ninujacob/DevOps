## About
An ad-hoc command in Ansible is a one-time command executed from the command line without the need to write a playbook. It allows you to perform quick tasks on remote hosts without creating separate playbook files. Ad-hoc commands are especially useful for tasks such as running a single command on multiple hosts, gathering information about hosts, or performing simple configuration tasks. Ad-hoc commands are executed using the ansible command with specified options and arguments
