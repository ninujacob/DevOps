## Ansible
Ansible is an open-source automation tool that simplifies configuration management, application deployment, and task automation. It uses a declarative language(YAML) to define desired states and executes tasks on remote systems over SSH(Linux) or WinRM(Windows), without requiring agents on the managed nodes.
