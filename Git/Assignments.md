## Assignment 1: Repository Operations
- Clone and Branch:
  - Clone a remote Git repository.
  - Create a new branch for a specific feature or bug fix.
  - Make changes in the new branch.
  - Push the branch to the remote repository.
- Merge and Conflict Resolution:
  - Merge the changes from the feature branch into the main branch.
  - Simulate a merge conflict intentionally (modify the same line in both branches).
  - Resolve the conflict and complete the merge.
- Rebase:
  - Create a new branch.
  - Make some changes.
  - Rebase the new branch onto the main branch.
  - Resolve any conflicts that may arise during the rebase.
## Assignment 2: Collaboration
- Fork and Pull Request:
  - Fork a repository on GitHub.
  - Clone the forked repository to your local machine.
  - Create a new branch and make changes.
  - Push the branch to your fork.
  - Open a pull request to merge your changes into the original repository.
- Code Review:
  - Review a pull request in a repository.
  - Provide constructive feedback on the changes.
  - Discuss improvements or changes with the author.
- Collaborative Workflow:
  - Set up a repository collaboratively with a partner.
  - Establish a workflow for making changes, creating branches, and merging.
## Assignment 3: Advanced Git Concepts
- Git Hooks:
  - Write a pre-commit hook that checks for code style violations before allowing a commit.
- Git Bisect:
  - Simulate a bug in your project history.
  - Use git **bisect** to find the commit where the bug was introduced.
- Git Submodules:
  - Create a repository with a submodule.
  - Update the submodule and commit the changes.
## GuideLines:
- Submit a well-organized document with clear headings and step numbers.
- Include all necessary screenshots and code snippets.
- Clearly explain the purpose and rationale behind each step.
- Ensure that your setup follows security best practices.
- Add troubleshooting steps,  If you encounter any issues during the setup.
- Use GitLab project to do the needful
